# Kalio — Selldone Layout

The official `selldone/storefront` app, customized for **Kalio** (shop 15645,
renamed **molino** on 3 November 2026; formerly `kalio-qz8Yoltw`), a grocery
marketplace, and published as the Layout package
**`kalio-market-hall`** (layout id 23). The package name is permanent; the
design it carries changed in 0.2.0.

## The design (0.2.0 onwards)

Built like a big grocery front — banner, aisles, rows of products — in
Kalio's own dress: white floor, deep green for every commerce action, coral
for a saving, Fraunces headings over DM Sans, and each aisle's products on a
pale tint of their own. The approved mockup is in
`../kalio-design/home-mockup/`.

| Area | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Home page: deals counter, aisles, rows, mosaic, sellers, shelf | `components/kalio/KalioHome.vue` and the components it composes |
| Deals counter (the hero): the week's offer beside a rail of deals | `components/kalio/KalioHero.vue` |
| Aisle row (two rows of round pictures) | `components/kalio/KalioAisleRibbon.vue` |
| Product rows with the platform quick-buy sheet | `components/kalio/KalioRail.vue`, `KalioSellerLine.vue` |
| Aisle mosaic, seller cards, market shelf | `components/kalio/KalioMosaic.vue`, `KalioSellerCards.vue`, `KalioShelf.vue` |
| Quick-buy sheet for every "+" (the product page's Kalio overview inside); the catalogue's "+" is routed to it | `components/kalio/KalioQuickBuy.vue`, `kalio-listing-quick-buy.ts` |
| Product page: breadcrumb, highlights, sections, aisle index | `pages/product/StorefrontPageProduct.vue`, `components/kalio/KalioAisleIndex.vue` |
| Product overview (packshot panel, buy column) — Selldone's SProductOverview logic via `extends`, Kalio markup | `components/kalio/product/KalioProductOverview.vue` |
| Seller offer cards — SSmartSelectVendor logic via `extends` | `components/kalio/product/KalioSellerOffers.vue` |
| In the basket: quantity and "Checkout · total" on the product page (design C); a card's "Add to basket" adds straight away and becomes − n in basket + (0.2.28; "See options" for sizes) | `components/kalio/product/KalioBasketLine.vue`, `KalioCardStep.vue`, `kalio-card-basket.ts`, `kalio-basket.ts` |
| Basket drawer (design C, 0.2.11): a receipt with the subtotal, savings and Checkout; compact rows with a stepper; three "Often added" | `components/kalio/shell/KalioBasketDrawer.vue` (styles in `kalio-shell.scss`, `.k-bdrawer`) |
| Basket page (design C, 0.2.12): lines by seller; Delivery method · Where · Who cards; a receipt with every line of Selldone's bill, the discount code and Pay; on a phone a bar with the total and Pay | `pages/basket/cart/StorefrontPageBasketCart.vue` (Selldone's script kept), `components/kalio/checkout/KalioCartLines.vue`, `components/kalio/KalioOftenAdded.vue` (also in the drawer) |
| Where: the address sheet (a light Mapbox map with a fixed pin, search, "Use my location", saved addresses, every address field) | `components/kalio/checkout/KalioAddressSheet.vue` |
| When: shipping methods and pickup points as cards, any time or days and parts of the day, or a date | `pages/basket/cart/SCartShippingOptions.vue` (Selldone's script kept), in the basket page's When sheet |
| Pay: Selldone's payment window restyled (heading, total on the stone ground, each way to pay as a card) | `style/kalio-checkout.scss` (`.s--storefront-master-payment-dialog`) |
| Order page: where it stands, Invoice and Share, the steps as a line, items by seller; Selldone's vendor orders, returns and refunds in Kalio cards | `pages/basket/order/StorefrontPageBasketOrder.vue`, `pages/basket/order/physical/dashbaord/StorefrontPageBasketOrderPhysicalDashboard.vue` |
| Order page cards (0.2.15, the trip 0.2.16): the receipt with how it is paid and Pay now; Delivery (deliver to, when, courier, carrier, tracking, billing, map, change address, the trip); Messages (bubbles and a message box, also on file and service orders) | `components/kalio/order/KalioOrderReceipt.vue`, `KalioOrderDelivery.vue`, `KalioOrderChat.vue` |
| Basket page, sheets, payment window and order page styles | `style/kalio-checkout.scss` |
| The shopper's account (0.2.18 design B / 0.2.19 design A): B — greeting, tabs, Overview (latest order with its steps, orders, saved with deals, wallet, gift cards, pay reminder, history, Buy again, addresses); A — side rail in three groups and order cards; both — grocery orders with filters and the kind picker, other kinds in Selldone's table under a Kalio head | `components/kalio/account/` (`kalio-account.ts`, `KalioAccountShell.vue`, `KalioAccountHome.vue`, `KalioOrdersBoard.vue`, `KalioOrderKinds.vue`, `KalioBuyAgain.vue`), `pages/user/StorefrontPageUser.vue`, `pages/user/orders/`, `style/kalio-account.scss`, the `/user` index route in `router/StorefrontRouter.ts` |
| Product page styles | `style/kalio-product.scss` |
| Shelf head (design A) for every shop page that lists products: crumbs, title, count, a row of aisle words | `components/kalio/KalioShelfHead.vue` |
| Aisle page head | `components/kalio/KalioAisleHeader.vue` |
| Seller storefront: shelf head with their mark and aisles; offers and one row per aisle | `components/kalio/KalioSellerHero.vue`, `KalioSellerShelf.vue` |
| Header: wordmark, Aisles menu, search, account, basket pill, aisle strip; basket and phone-menu drawers | `components/kalio/shell/KalioHeader.vue` |
| Footer: a band with the shop's counts, aisles, sellers, shop links (the merchant's footer menu), account | `components/kalio/shell/KalioFooter.vue` |
| Sign-in sheet (Selldone's SShopLogin inside) | `components/kalio/shell/KalioSignIn.vue` |
| Catalogue header: "All products", a search or the deals, with the count | `components/kalio/KalioCatalogueHeader.vue` |
| Header, footer, drawers, sign-in, catalogue toolbar, filter panel | `style/kalio-shell.scss` |

| Typefaces (loaded by the app) | `components/kalio/kalio-fonts.ts` |
| Shop page choosing home / aisle / seller / catalogue | `pages/products/StorefrontPageProducts.vue` |
| Empty basket, 404 | `pages/basket/cart/StorefrontPageBasketCart.vue`, `pages/errors/404/` |
| Tokens and shared pieces | `style/kalio-tokens.scss` |
| Skin for Selldone's own components | `style/kalio-platform.scss` |
| Kalio's own sections | `style/kalio-sections.scss` |

The shop pages (aisles, the catalogue, search, deals, sellers) follow
design A of three drawn on 3 November 2026 in `../kalio-design/aisle-options/`:
named in type rather than painted, every packshot on one stone well
(`--k-well`), the saving as coral type, a quiet filter sidebar, and the sort
as one menu. The aisle tints stay on the home page.

The home's top and middle (0.2.4) come from three options drawn in
`../kalio-design/hero-options/` on 3 November 2026: the deals counter was
chosen for the top, the aisle mosaic and the market shelf for the middle.

Commerce markup and state are untouched: cards, quick-buy, basket, checkout,
variants and vendor offers are Selldone's components, re-skinned. Kalio adds
the aisle tint, the unit and the seller line around the platform card.

A merchant's custom header or footer code still wins over Kalio's
(`layouts/StorefrontLayout.vue`).

The filter panel is Selldone's (`SCategoryFilter`), restyled: on desktop it
sits inside the catalogue column beside the grid and is only as tall as its
filters; the aisle sign and the seller storefront above it stay full width.
On a phone it is a sheet over the page, and the header and bottom bar step
aside while it is open.

The catalogue starts on the normal grid even where the shop's theme names
Insta as a device's default (`StorefrontPageProducts.vue`): Insta hides a
card's name until hover and drops the "+" below a laptop. A shopper who
picks Insta from the toolbar keeps it; Kalio draws it as a denser grid with
the name and price shown.

The shop page shows the home sections only when it has no query. Search,
filters, sorts, "See all deals" and "Browse every product" all add a query,
and then Selldone's listing shows instead.

Facts that shape the code:

- **Fonts load from the app, not `index.html`.** In production the Layout
  runs inside Selldone's own HTML; `index.html` never reaches a visitor.
- **Image sizes.** Category icons resize to any size. Seller and product
  images exist only as the original and a 128px thumbnail; any other size is
  a 404 (`kalio-catalog.ts`).
- **The struck price follows the chosen seller** (`kalio-offer-price.ts`).
  Selldone's price section paid the seller's price but took the struck
  price and the percent off from the product or size; it is amended where
  the product page, the quick-buy sheets and the catalogue load. Deals are
  real only when each seller's offer carries the discount: on 3 November
  2026 every offer on the 80 discounted products was given 20% of its own
  price (snapshots in the session scratchpad, `dealfix/`).
- **Adding from a card** (`kalio-basket.ts`): a product with sizes opens
  the quick-buy sheet; any other goes into the basket from its cheapest
  offer with stock. Counts are set through the storefront's own
  AddToBasket / RemoveFromBasket; AddToBasket announces a first add
  (`kalio:basket-added`) for the notice. Selldone's green in-basket strip
  is not mounted (`layouts/StorefrontLayout.vue`).
- **Taps never wait for the server** (0.2.11). A basket answer takes about
  a second, sometimes three. Every stepper (card, shelf, product page,
  drawer) shows the count tapped at once (`wanted` in `kalio-basket.ts`);
  the requests for a line go out one at a time, each with the latest count,
  and a change of seller waits its turn and keeps the count. Before this
  the buttons were disabled while a request ran, so a quick second tap was
  lost, and changing the seller during a slow "+" sent the old count: on 4
  November 2026, 2 quarts from Alina became 1 from Mason.
- **The basket page** keeps Selldone's whole script (bill, basket config,
  coupons, lottery, club, wallet, shipping options, payment, service
  orders); only its template is Kalio's. Coupons and lottery prizes show
  only when the shopper has some (no empty "Add coupon" row). Pay leads
  to whatever is still missing (address, phone, email) before it opens
  the payment window. The When card shows only when there is something to
  choose; on 4 November 2026 molino has one method, Pickup, with no pickup
  point, so it does not show and Selldone asks only for an address.
- **The address sheet** (0.2.13 after a buyer's walk-through at 1920×923,
  1440×900, 1366×700 and 390×844, `../kalio-design/review/buyer.cjs`):
  the map is `streets-v12` (the light style read as a grey, broken map);
  a tap on the map takes the pin there and a tap on the pin looks up the
  address under it; a lookup replaces street, city, county and postcode
  together (no New York street with a London postcode); below zoom 13 the
  pin asks to zoom in; the map and the form have a fixed height and the
  footer sits above them (the map, a positioned box, used to paint over
  Save address when the form grew taller than the window). It started
  from Selldone's Mapbox wrapper with the
  `light-v11` style and Selldone's address lookups (`gto-to-address`,
  `autocomplete`, `address/all`); it saves the same receiver_info fields
  (`no`, `unit`, `name`, `phone`, …). mapbox-gl.css gives `.mapboxgl-map`
  `position: relative`, which collapsed the map to 0 px; the canvas keeps
  `position: absolute !important`.
- **No way to pay**: when the shop has no payment method for the
  basket's currency, the receipt says so and Pay does not open an empty
  payment window (`payment_ways`, `pay_blocker`).
- **Payment methods**: on 4 November 2026 the storefront first received no
  payment method (`shop.gateways` was empty); later that day the owner
  switched on Cash on delivery and a Motorbike method, and placed the
  first order, SM-1 (basket 29504, $55.15 with $25 delivery).
- **The order page's payment, delivery and chat** (0.2.15; the upload
  named 0.2.14 carried 0.2.13's files, see the release steps). Selldone's
  payment table, receiver widget and full-screen chat window gave way to
  Kalio cards (`components/kalio/order/`): the receipt in the side column
  now says how the order is paid (by card with the date, cash to the
  courier, cash at the shop, a bank transfer, or "Pay now" and "Use
  another way to pay" while an online payment waits), the Delivery card
  lists deliver to, when, tracking and billing beside a small map, with
  "Change address" (the address sheet) and billing edited in place, and
  the messages sit on the page as bubbles with a box under them. The
  sums follow Selldone's: an order's `price` is after every discount and
  the wallet, with delivery in it (the receipt used to add delivery
  again: SM-1 showed $80.15 instead of $55.15, and "Discount" repeated
  "You saved"). A bank transfer's details and receipt upload stay
  Selldone's row. On a phone the receipt follows the items, and the
  bottom bar hides while any sheet or window is open (it covered the
  address sheet's Save). Tested with SM-1's own data and three variants
  (paid and sent, waiting for payment, delivered):
  `../kalio-design/review/ordercards.cjs`.
- **"The trip" in the Delivery card** (0.2.16). Selldone's
  `DeliveryTimeline` (Vuetify's `v-timeline`) has no styles in this
  layout: once SM-1 was delivered its lines and dates spilled over the
  Messages card. The card now writes the transportation order itself:
  left the shop, the carrier's updates (`history`), delivered (with the
  time on the road), paid the courier (cash on delivery), came back to
  the shop, cancelled, and "On the way to you" with a beating dot while
  it travels; the day is written once. Courier (name, Call) and Carrier
  rows join the list, and `transportation_order.track` backs "Follow the
  parcel". "Has it arrived?" stays away once the parcel came back. Test
  variants `live` (SM-1 as delivered), `moving`, `carrier`; the script
  also reports anything sticking out of a card (`spill`).
- **The account** (0.2.18 B, 0.2.19 A; mockups in
  `../kalio-design/account-options/`). Selldone's history list gives each
  order's status, delivery state, price, items (product id and count), chat,
  place and date, but no label, sellers or payment: those come from the
  order itself, read only for the orders on screen and kept for the visit
  (`kalio-account.ts`), so a row shows "SM-1" once its order is read.
  Filters count the orders read (30 at a time). "Buy again" on an order puts
  its lines back with their size and seller (`reorder` in `kalio-basket.ts`);
  the "Buy again" shelf maps past products onto today's catalogue
  (`offers()`). `/user` is the Overview in B and redirects to the orders in A;
  a guest sees only the orders kept on the device. "My account" in the
  header menu and footer opens `/user`. Tested with a stand-in shopper put
  in the app's store and every account read answered by the test (nothing
  sent): `../kalio-design/review/accountcheck.cjs` (variants full, real,
  empty, guest, reload; `--dist` serves a local build in place of a
  release; `DETAIL=slow|fail` delays or refuses the full order).
  Not tried for real: "Buy again" against the live basket.
  Since 0.2.20 nothing waits forever on the full order: the Overview's
  lines show at once from the list (picture, name from the catalogue,
  quantity) and gain prices and sellers when the order is read; a failed
  read is tried once more, then the order is marked `missing`. After a
  reload `USER()` is empty while the app asks who is signed in
  (`getBusyUser`): `userKnown()` waits for the answer before reading orders
  or sending a "guest" from the Overview to the orders. Before 0.2.20 a
  reload read the orders as a guest first; the next read as the shopper
  cleared the orders but not the cache of full-order reads, so every
  order stayed unread ("SM-29504", no seller, no delivery time).
  A's order cards name the five steps under their bars (0.2.21): an icon
  and a word each (`TRAIL`: Placed, Accepted, Packing, On the way,
  Delivered), the current one in green; Selldone's own name is the tooltip.
- **Vuetify draws icons as `<i>`.** A rule for a decorative `i` must say
  `> i` when a `<v-icon>` can sit inside it: the order page's progress
  circles used `.k-order__step i`, which also caught the tick and pinned
  it to the circle's top-left (2 px left, 4 px up) until 0.2.17.
  `../kalio-design/review/tickprobe.cjs` measures the tick's offset.
- **The basket drawer** reads the savings from the lines (`dis` × count +
  `offer_amount`): a basket read on page load has no `bill`. The "Added to
  basket" notice keeps quiet while the drawer is open (`basketView`).
- **Nothing is named.** Aisles, sellers, deals, slides and tiles all come
  from live data; an aisle Kalio does not know still gets a tint, a row and,
  if featured, a tile.
- **Vuetify's primary is Kalio's green** (0.2.22, `kalio-tokens.scss`). The
  shop's theme makes it purple (112, 85, 126), so Selldone's parts that
  Kalio keeps (gift cards, addresses, the GDPR panel, the payment window)
  showed purple buttons; `--v-theme-primary` and `-secondary` are set to the
  green and deep green.
- **The QA pass of 5 November 2026 (0.2.22).** `../kalio-design/review/`:
  - `qasweep.cjs` opens every kind of page (home, aisles, deals, all,
    search with and without results, sellers, four kinds of product page,
    basket, guest orders, an order not one's own, blog, FAQ, the official
    pages) at p390, t768, t1024 and d1440, scrolls each to the end, takes a
    full-page shot and runs `qa-audit.js` (overlapping or clipped text,
    things past the edge, broken pictures, "undefined", raw keys);
  - `qasheets.py` cuts the shots into contact sheets for reading by eye;
  - `buyer.cjs`, `accountcheck.cjs` (variant `tour`: every account section;
    `SIZES=` for tablet sizes) and `ordercards.cjs` (`SIZES=`) audit too.

  Full-page shots put fixed bars (header, phone bottom bar, the floating
  buy bar) in mid-page: not bugs. What the pass fixed: the basket page
  crashed blank for a guest without a basket (`receiver_info` of null);
  Deals → All products kept "Only discounted" (`SProductsListing` now
  follows `?filter`); empty search, filters or aisle said nothing
  (`.k-noresult`); an order one may not open showed dots and "Cart not
  found" (`.k-order__missing`); About/Terms/Privacy without a profile were
  blank with an error (`KalioOfficialMissing`, and a Kalio frame); the FAQ
  was Selldone's bar and grey all-caps button; the aisle tabs kept the last
  aisle's scroll and hid the tab under the arrow; the phone account row did
  not scroll to the open section; the floating buy bar's 220 px button left
  the name "Dairy…"; struck old prices crossed only the dollars; the grey
  spec table; the bottom bar's Home changed icon and lit on other pages;
  the header aisle row had no way to its end at 1024 px (arrows, wheel);
  load-more read "62 More.." in blue under the filters; headings left one
  word alone (`text-wrap: balance`); the update notice; the wallet's empty
  page; Selldone's account sections dressed in Kalio's buttons.
  0.2.23 (found by the owner): on the home shelf the in-basket − n + sat
  in the label's corner over the price; it now stands above the label on
  the packshot's corner. A struck price inside `<s>` ("was $1.78", basket
  lines) is drawn as one line across, as on the product page.
  **Five fixes live in Selldone's synced `modules/`** (the product list's
  filter and empty state and load-more, the price chip, the update notice,
  the bottom bar, the words "basket" and "Sort by"). `modules/` is not
  tracked here, so they are kept as patches:
  `patches/modules-components.kalio.patch` and
  `patches/modules-translate.kalio.patch`. After the modules are restored
  or upgraded, apply them with
  `git -C modules/components apply ../../patches/modules-components.kalio.patch`
  (and the same for `modules/translate`); a patch that no longer applies
  must be redone by hand, not skipped.
  **Not fixed (shop content, not the Layout):** about 140 product
  descriptions carry the generator's notes ("The fictional PantryVale name
  is printed consistently on the package and saved in the actual product
  brand field…") and a few have a missing word ("a soft with a gently
  swirled crumb"); the blog holds Selldone's demo posts (power tools,
  gaming microphones); About/Terms/Privacy are not written; "DairyCove
  Whole Milk 1 gal" opens on its 1 quart size.
- **0.2.24 (5 November 2026): the owner's picks from two mockups each.**
  - *Home shelf, buy strip (A)* (`kalio-design/shelf-step-options`): the
    label's foot is "+ Add", and in the basket "− n +" in the same place
    (`KalioCardStep` `strip`). 0.2.23's stepper on the packshot was
    rejected ("jumping up is not a good idea").
  - *Journal B, note A, About B, Terms A, Privacy A*
    (`kalio-design/pages-options`), in `components/kalio/pages/` and
    `style/kalio-pages.scss`. The journal and a note read Selldone's blog
    API directly (`kalio-journal.ts`; asked with `extra` the list answers
    no posts, so the side lists are a second call). A note's shopping box
    lists the shop's products it names, else this week's deals; "Add all"
    adds them one at a time. Comments are still Selldone's.
  - *Sample text the owner asked for:* About/Terms/Privacy show general
    text (`kalio-sample-pages.ts`) under an amber "Sample text — molino is
    a test shop" note (`KalioSampleNote`) until the shop writes its own
    profile; the journal and a note show the note when the posts are
    Selldone's demo posts (their pictures sit in another shop's folder).
    Nothing is written to the shop.
  - *Cookie choices* on Privacy are Selldone's real ones (the shop's apps,
    "GDPR-Cookie"); molino runs no app, so the page says there is nothing
    optional rather than showing switches that do nothing.
  - `.k-about` is the product page's "About this product"; About us is
    `.k-story`.
  - **Sticky does not work inside Vuetify's wrapper** (`.v-application`
    has `overflow: hidden`): the header's `position: sticky` and the
    product page's sticky packshot have never stuck. These pages switch
    the wrapper to `overflow: clip` (with `:has()`) so their side columns
    stick, and keep the header scrolling away as everywhere else. Doing
    it site-wide would make the header stick on every page: the owner's
    call.
- **0.2.25 (5 November 2026): the account's address book.** Each address
  is a card (small map with the pin, flag and name, address, receiver,
  note) with Edit and Delete; Delete asks once in the card
  (`DELETE_MY_ADDRESSES`). New and Edit open `KalioAddressSheet` with
  `titled` ("Name this address" with Home / Work / Other first, no saved
  list, phone optional, Save waits on the page), replacing Selldone's
  "New Address Name" dialog and full-screen map. `kalio-design/review/
  addresscheck.cjs` runs the whole flow with every write caught.
- **0.2.26 (6 November 2026): a shopper's pass on phone, tablet and
  computer** (`kalio-design/review/buyer2.cjs`: seven products, three of
  each, from the shelf and three aisles, in a real guest basket; the map
  dragged with a finger, tapped, zoomed, searched, located; the address
  saved; `/buy/` blocked). Fixed:
  - the cards' "+" is drawn at 28px (was 44px, "too big" for the owner)
    with an invisible 44px ring that still takes the tap; the in-basket
    stepper on a card is 36px tall (was 44px);
  - the quick-buy sheet (only products with sizes open it) says so ("This
    one comes in sizes…") and its X is a round grey button, not a bare
    glyph;
  - the basket's "When · Truck." card is "Delivery method": the method
    and its cost as the line, the time ("Any time", a day…) as the chip;
    its sheet asks "How should it reach you?";
  - the map's search box says "Search a street and number" (Selldone's
    lookup is Mapbox geocoding: streets, not landmarks — "Empire State
    Building" found Surat, India, or nothing), and says when nothing was
    found; the map follows its box's size (ResizeObserver).
  **Live on molino** (uploaded 6 November 2026 as deploy 357, release
  `01M6RTZKV257EPTGKQGTK9AYSB`; 0.2.25 was never uploaded, 0.2.26 carries it).
  Seen, not changed: "DairyCove Whole Milk 1 gal" opens on its 1 quart size
  (shop data); Selldone's `UPaymentStripeSplit` warns that `$product` is
  not provided on the basket page (harmless).
- **0.2.27 (6 November 2026), from the owner's phone screenshot of the home rails:** the
  card's "1 in basket" broke into three lines and spilled out of the 36px pill (0.2.26 had
  lowered it from 44px) — it never wraps now, and below 170px of card (a phone's rails) the
  pill keeps the number alone (`@container`); compare is hidden on every touch screen (it
  read as a second "+"); "Added to basket" keeps its title on one line and, on phones and
  tablets, sits at the foot above the bottom bar instead of over the section being shopped
  (above a tablet product page's floating buy bar while that shows).
- **0.2.28 (6 November 2026), from the owner's nine phone screenshots:**
  - **Cards, after Amazon's grocery cards:** "Add to basket" across every card's foot,
    and once tapped the same place reads "− 1 in basket +" (the number alone where the
    pill is under 140px); a product with sizes says "See options" and opens the
    quick-buy sheet, whose "This one comes in sizes" hint is gone; out of stock says so.
    `KalioCardStep` (`card`) draws it, inside Selldone's card through
    `kalio-card-basket.ts`, or under a rail's unit and sellers (`KalioRail`). The round
    "+" on the packshot is hidden; a listing row stretches its cards so the feet line up.
  - **No "Added to basket" notice** (`KalioBasketToast` and its event are gone) and **no
    phone bottom bar** (`SFooterNavigation` is not mounted): the phone header has the
    account beside the basket; the basket's pay bar, the product page's buy bar, the
    chat button and the update notice sit at the foot.
  - **Compare badge** in the shop's deep green with a leaf ring (was the theme's purple
    and pink), not on the basket/checkout or the comparison page, above the product
    page's buy bar on a phone.
  - **Checkout:** the billing toggle's words wrap inside their halves ("Different billing
    address" ran under "Same for billing"); "Who" says "Checking your sign-in…" while
    the account is still loading instead of "Sign in".
  - **Address sheet:** suggestions while typing — the input's own value, since v-model
    waits for an Android keyboard's composition to end, so nothing was looked up until
    the search key (3 letters, 350 ms); up to 760px two steps — the map as tall as the
    window with the address under the pin and Continue, then the details on their own
    with the address on top (Change, Back), Save scrolling to the field still missing.
    Below the map the fields had sat under the Save button, unseen.
  `kalio-design/review/cardcheck.cjs` checks all of it on a phone, tablet and computer.
- **0.2.29 (6 November 2026):** the footer's "Basket" linked to `/basket/physical`; the basket
  page looks the basket up by type and only `PHYSICAL` matches, so it showed "Basket is empty"
  with products in it. Every basket link now passes `PHYSICAL` (found while taking the GitHub
  screenshots; checked live). The repository now lives at
  <https://github.com/selldone-custom-layouts/official-molino> (`origin`; `upstream` is
  selldone/storefront, fetch-only), with the README, `selldone-layout.json`, screenshots from
  the live shop in `docs/screenshots/` and the wiki's source in `docs/wiki/`.
- **0.2.31 (7 November 2026): a tester's feedback.**
  - **Product photos at the size they are shown.** Selldone keeps every photo at 1000×1000
    (about 110KB as WebP) and its CDN offers only 64 and 128 thumbnails, so a 200px card
    pulled the whole photo. Cards, rows, the mosaic, seller cards, Often added and the
    journal's mini products now carry a `srcset` (`productSrcset` in `kalio-catalog.ts`):
    Selldone's 128 thumbnail and 256–768 from the kalio Worker's `/img` resizer (Cloudflare
    Images, AVIF/WebP at q65, cached a year, Selldone's CDN only). The full photo stays the
    `src`; an image that fails drops the srcset (`dropSrcset`, and `kalio_srcset_failed` in
    SShopProductCard). Measured on the dev server: an aisle 597KB → 84KB of photos on a
    computer, the home 1.4MB → 252KB on a phone.
  - **Compare that does not look like loading.** The card's ring icon (`data_saver_on`) and
    the blinking dot once picked read as a spinner; the floating button was a ring that filled
    up. Now a "☐ Compare" / "☑ Comparing" pill in the picture's corner (it stays while picked),
    a "⇄ Compare 2" pill at the foot that bumps once when a product joins (no bump with
    reduced motion), and the product page's compare button with a tick box
    (SShopProductCard, SComparisonButton, SProductSectionExtraButtons in the components patch).
  - **No sound when signing in.** Selldone's SShopLogin and ShopEmailLogin played a "tick";
    both are silent.
  - **One word: Saved.** The account menu, the saved page and its title said Favorites,
    Favorite Items and Wishlist; all say Saved, like the header (translate patch). The
    product page's heart says Save / Saved.
  - **States not only in colour.** A dark focus ring on everything that can be pressed, the
    words of filled buttons underlined on hover, and a chosen size with a thicker ring, bold
    words and a tick.
- **0.2.30 (7 November 2026): ratings and reviews, design A** of three
  (`../kalio-design/reviews-options/`). molino has no reviews, so they had never been drawn;
  with ratings, Selldone's yellow stars appeared on every card ("4.2 ● 19 rev…", cut off) and
  the Reviews block was Selldone's ("/ 5", blue criteria bars, the purple "People love it!").
  - **Cards:** `KalioCardRating`, "★★★★☆ 4.2 (19)" on one line under the name, laid into the
    card's rating column by `kalio-card-basket.ts` (rails too); Selldone's stars and
    "● 19 reviews" are hidden, colour swatches stay. Below 160px of card (a phone's rails)
    the stars shrink, below 112px the count goes. Nothing shows until someone has rated.
  - **Stars** are one element, `.k-stars` in `kalio-tokens.scss`: a star mask repeated five
    times over an amber gradient that stops at score × 20% (`--k-rate`, `--k-star`).
  - **Under the product title:** stars, the score and "1,240 ratings", which scrolls to
    Reviews.
  - **Reviews** (`KalioReviews`, replacing SProductComments): a summary column — the score,
    stars, how many rated, "How it rates" (the shop's criteria; `ratings[].value / count`),
    the guest's sign-in prompt or, for a buyer (`$product.bought`), Selldone's own rating
    input — beside Selldone's comments (SArticleComments) restyled as rows: name, date,
    "Verified Buyer", the writer's own stars, the text, the shop's reply. An empty list
    reads "No reviews yet.".
  - **What Selldone has, and what it doesn't:** a product's average and count, the shop's
    criteria with averages, and comments (name, date, text, shop's reply, buyer flag and the
    writer's criteria scores). No 5-to-1 breakdown, no "helpful" votes, no review photos and
    no sort by rating (the product list sorts by visits, likes, newest, best selling and
    price), so none is drawn. "Customer reviews" in the sort menu needs Selldone first.
  - Checked with sample ratings and comments answered by the test browser only
    (`../kalio-design/review/reviewscheck.cjs`; `--nofill` for the shop as it is, `--dist`
    for a local build on the live shop): phone, tablet, computer.

Market Hall, the first design, is tagged `market-hall-0.1.5`.

## Release

**Going live (from 6 November 2026, the owner's wish): after the upload is verified, pin the
shop to it yourself** with the Selldone MCP connector: `selldone_current_connection` must say
shop 15645, then `selldone_api_call` `api.shops.layout.set`, `confirm: true`, body
`{"mode":"private","layout_id":23,"layout_version":"<exact version>"}` (never `latest`).
Every domain inherits the shop default. Check `https://molino.selldone.shop/` (no query: a
query shows the catalogue instead of the home) names the release in `window.sdShopLayout`.
The CLI must be signed in (`~/.selldone-dev/.persist` not empty); `selldone login` is not a
command — the owner signs in from the `selldone` menu and types the 2FA code.

The official build and `selldone-cli` 1.0.16 do not pass the current upload
endpoint. The steps below are what does. Never re-upload a version: a version
may be registered even when the client reports an error.

**The account has two designs, picked at build time** (4 November 2026):
B, "home" (greeting, tabs, Overview), is the default; A, "desk" (side rail,
order cards), is built with `VITE_KALIO_ACCOUNT=desk`. 0.2.18 is B and 0.2.19
is A, uploaded side by side so the owner can choose. **The owner chose A**
(4 November 2026, asking only for the steps of its progress bar to be
named): **every release from 0.2.21 on is built with `desk`**
(`release.sh <version> desk`) unless the owner says otherwise. 0.2.20 was
the last B.
`../kalio-design/review/release.sh <version> [desk]` runs every step below
and the server check.

```bash
# 1. bump "version" in manifest.json (never reuse one)
npm run build-production                  # design A: VITE_KALIO_ACCOUNT=desk npm run build-production
rm dist/index.html                        # every ZIP member must be under app/
node scripts/kalio-svg-flatten.mjs dist/app
file -b --mime-type dist/app/js/*.js | sort | uniq -c   # no text/x-java allowed
python <cli-source>/.agents/skills/package-selldone-storefront-layout/scripts/package_layout.py dist dist.zip --manifest manifest.json --force
unzip -p dist.zip app/shop.js | cmp - dist/app/shop.js   # the ZIP is this build
node scripts/kalio-deploy.mjs "$(npm root -g)/selldone-cli"
```

`<cli-source>` is a clone of github.com/selldone/cli; the npm package does
not ship `.agents/`. Locally, `file` calls a few large lazy chunks
`application/octet-stream`; the server has served those as JavaScript
(checked on 0.2.2), so only `text/x-java` blocks a release.

Without `--force` the packager keeps an existing `dist.zip` (it says so on
stderr and still prints PASS for the old file): on 4 November 2026 the upload
named 0.2.14 carried 0.2.13's files that way.

`kalio-deploy.mjs` reuses the official CLI's saved login, 2FA check and version
check, and sends the manifest as JSON text of the six contract keys.

Then confirm on the server, not by exit code: `GET
https://api.selldone.com/developer/layouts/23/deploys` must show the version
with `extracting: false`, `error: null`, and `file_manifest` hashes equal to
`dist/app/shop.js` and `dist/app/shop.css`.

### Why each step exists (found by probing the endpoint, 2 November 2026)

- **`app/` output, relative base** (`vite.config.ts`). The extractor wants
  `app/shop.js` + `app/shop.css`. Releases are stored at
  `layouts/<id>/releases/<ULID>/app`, so every chunk and asset reference is
  relative to where `shop.js` is served.
- **Safe file names** (`safeName` in `vite.config.ts`). A space or bracket in
  any member name rejects the archive.
- **Passive SVG** (`scripts/kalio-svg-flatten.mjs`). The scanner whitelists SVG
  attributes; `style`, `<style>`, `xml:space`, `enable-background`, `fx/fy`,
  `display`, character references in values and more are refused. The script
  turns CSS into plain attributes and drops what has no equivalent; every
  rewrite was pixel-compared against the original.
- **Every chunk reads as JavaScript** (`sniffAsJavaScript` in
  `vite.config.ts`). The service stores each file with the MIME type libmagic
  reads from its content; a chunk opening with `import{…}` reads as Java, and
  browsers refuse a module served as `text/x-java`. 40 of 0.1.4's chunks were
  served that way; from 0.1.5 every JS file opens with `"use strict";`.
- **Fewer files** (`assetsInlineLimit`, `cssCodeSplit: false`,
  `experimentalMinChunkSize`, flags from jsDelivr). The endpoint processes the
  archive inside the request, behind Cloudflare's ~100 s read limit; at 714
  files it was cut mid-extraction. At 363 it completes.

## Live

Uploading creates a **beta** version; it does not change any shop. Attaching
is a dashboard action (shop → Layout setting → *Molino Market Hall* (named Kalio Market Hall until 3 November 2026), then the
version). Since Selldone's new layout loader (3 November 2026) the shop
loads the version **selected** there; a new upload is not picked up until it
is selected. The designed home is the shop page, so set the shop's **Home**
to **Shop**; a Page Builder landing page there replaces it on `/` (the
Kalio home is still at `/shop`).

**How Selldone loads a Layout now.** The shop page carries an inline loader,
`window.sdShopLayout`, whose config names the selected release as
`https://selldone.com/cdn-storage-public/layouts/23/releases/<ULID>/app/shop.js`.
That address answers **302** to `https://cdn.selldone.com/public/…/shop.js`.
A browser keys a module by the address it asked for but resolves its
imports against the address it landed on, so any chunk importing
`../shop.js` loads a second copy of the app: the page-builder home flashes,
then the page goes blank. That is what broke 0.2.0. From 0.2.1 the build
keeps everything in a `core` chunk (`coreChunk` in `vite.config.ts`) and no
chunk imports `shop.js`. Kario's Layouts are built the same way as 0.2.0 but
work because they were uploaded before the change: their files are served
straight from `layouts.selldone.com`, no redirect.

**Previewing a release before it is selected:**

```bash
node --use-system-ca scripts/kalio-live-preview.mjs <release-ULID> 9125
```

serves the shop's real HTML with the loader pointed at that release, through
Selldone's own redirect (launch entry `kalio-live-preview`). The ULID is in
the deploy path from `GET /developer/layouts/23/deploys`.
`--use-system-ca` is needed when Node is started outside a shell here; the
bundled CA store rejects Selldone's chain.

Release checks that matter, beyond the hashes: every `dist/app/js/*.js` reads
as JavaScript to `file --mime-type`, `grep -l 'from"../shop.js"'
dist/app/js/*.js` finds nothing, and `find dist/app -type f | wc -l` stays
under ~360 (fonts ship as WOFF2 only, SVGs up to 16 KB are inlined).
